<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![MTS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaryCastillo8/Morazan-Tracking-Software/main/img/tracking1.png)

MTS is a tracking and orbit propagator software. Shows the world map with the position of the CubeSat and Cabañas ground station, located in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. It also display the CubeSat trajectory and coverage in real time.

The main purposes:
* Show the real-time location of the satellite
* Find its orbital parameters
* Show the visibility window
* To know the events above Central America and Cabañas ground station.

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!
